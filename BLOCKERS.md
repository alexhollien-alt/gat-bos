# BLOCKERS.md

Broken integrations waiting for a dedicated plumbing session. Build sessions that hit a broken integration **fill-and-flag** (hardcoded fallback + entry here) and keep building.

Each open item: timestamp, what's broken, where it lives (file/line), what's needed to fix. Resolutions move to `## Resolved` with the date and closing commit.

## Open

### [2026-04-21] `contacts` table missing `slug`, `photo_url`, `tagline` columns
- **Broken:** No DB-backed source for agent landing page data. `/agents/[slug]` cannot query Supabase for the agent record.
- **Where:** `src/app/agents/[slug]/page.tsx` -- `AGENTS` const hardcoded at top of file (Julie + Fiona + Denise for Sessions 2-4).
- **Fix needed:** Supabase migration adding `contacts.slug text unique`, `contacts.photo_url text`, `contacts.tagline text`; backfill Julie + Fiona + Denise; then refactor the page to `await supabase.from('contacts').select(...).eq('slug', slug).single()`. Keep RLS open for anon SELECT on those three columns only.

### [2026-04-21] Fiona Bigbee + Denise van den Bossche phone/website missing from CONTACT.md
- **Broken:** Contact block on `/agents/fiona-bigbee` and `/agents/denise-van-den-bossche` renders email only. `AgentRecord.phone|phoneHref|website|websiteHref` set to `null`; conditional render hides the rows. `RealEstateAgent` JSON-LD `telephone` + `url` fields ship as `null` on both pages.
- **Where:** `src/app/agents/[slug]/page.tsx` -- `AGENTS["fiona-bigbee"]` and `AGENTS["denise-van-den-bossche"]`. Upstream source: `~/Documents/Alex Hub(Obs)/05_AGENTS/Fiona Bigbee/CONTACT.md` and `~/Documents/Alex Hub(Obs)/05_AGENTS/Denise van den Bossche/CONTACT.md` (email-only at present).
- **Fix needed:** Alex confirms phone + website (or website=none) for each. Update both CONTACT.md files to include phone + website fields, then backfill the `AGENTS` const (or `contacts.phone` / `contacts.website` once Blocker #1 resolves). Carrying through Session 4; pages read as partial contact coverage until fixed.
